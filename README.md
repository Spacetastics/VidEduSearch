# VideoSearch Academy
VideoSearch Academy is an app created by Naadir Bakari, Salma Benderson, Joshua Saji, and Noah Cil for the MoCoHacks Hackathon (3/19/21-3/21/21).

The app provides the user with educational videos for their desired subject or topic, which they enter into the search bar. The videos it returns are on the shorter side by default, but the user can choose to include longer videos in their search result.
