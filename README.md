# VideoSearch Academy
VideoSearch Academy is an app created by Naadir Bakari, Salma Benderson, Joshua Saji, and Noah Cil for the MoCoHacks Hackathon (3/19/21-3/21/21).

The app provides the user with educational videos for their desired subject or topic, which they enter into the search bar. The user can filter the length of the videos that the app returns, having the option to find shorter or longer ones depending on what they are looking for.
